This dataset consists of a single PET measurement of a human brain using [11C]DASB to measure serotonin transporter availability. An anatomical T1-weighted MRI is also available. There are no arterial measurements available for this tracer.

It has been broken for testing purposes. Changes made (in /sub-01/ses-01/pet/sub-01_ses-01_pet.json):
- Manufacturer set to a number (expecting string).
- InjectedMass removed (required).
- TracerMolecularWeightUnit removed (required when TracerMolecularWeight is set).
