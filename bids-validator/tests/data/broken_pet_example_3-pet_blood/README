This dataset consists of a single PET measurement of a human brain using [11C]DASB to measure serotonin transporter availability. An anatomical T1-weighted MRI is also available. There are arterial measurements available for this tracer. Note: all image files are empty for privacy reasons. 

IMPORTANT: The molar activity is fixed for all subjects (55 MBq/nmol) given Parsey et al. 2007.
